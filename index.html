			MATHETA Dance is an afro-modern, storytelling dance company. The name Matheta plays on the word thetha, which in the South African Xhosa language means to talk.  The company speaks through movement. We believe that dance is a language of the spirit with the power to impact and uplift people - to be used both as a medium for social activism, and as a practice for embodying beauty and joy in motion. We are a project-based company based in New York City with dreams to establish a strong presence in both the U.S. and South Africa.
